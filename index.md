## [](#header-2) DFS traversals
DFS traversal is a super basic and useful hack to solve tree problems or related. Good examples of such problems are LC 104 [Maximum Depth of Binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/) and [Convert BST to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/description/). Max Depth of BT should be very straight forward, using the DFS. Every time the function is poped from the recursion stack, return current depth + 1. If null node is reached, return 0 as current depth. Return all the depths to ```Math.max()```, which will filter out the branches with smaller depthes. Convert BST to Greater Tree is a little tricky. One place people(like me) may ignore is, when the DFS traversed all the nodes on the right side, the pointer will go back to the right most node on the left side, which does not have the previous value from the right side. To avoid this error, I used a class attribute called ```sum``` to record previous sums. When the node pointer go back to root and started the traverse the left side of tree, I still have the previous sum. ETC...

# [](#header-1)Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## [](#header-2)Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
